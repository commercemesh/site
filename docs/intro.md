# Commerce Mesh Protocol (CMP)

## Protocols, not platforms. Four primitives. Infinite possibility.

CMP is an open protocol designed for the future of commerce. We're building modular, programmable commerce infrastructure that enables:

- üîç **Product discovery** across networks
- üí∞ **Secure and transparent** transactions  
- ü§ù **Trust models** without centralized gatekeepers
- üì¶ **Flexible supply chain** fulfillment

## Why Commerce Mesh Protocol?

The future of commerce will be built on open protocols, not closed platforms. CMP defines standards and infrastructure for four core commerce primitives:

### 1. Discover
Find products across decentralized networks. No more walled gardens.

### 2. Transact  
Execute commerce transactions with transparency and programmability.

### 3. Trust
Build reputation and trust without centralized intermediaries.

### 4. Fulfillment
Route orders efficiently through flexible supply chains.
